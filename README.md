# AdvancedIfElseStatements
In this project I learned to organize my thought on how the program should operate by use of pseudo code and a flow chart. I also learned 
more complex uses of If/Else statements nested within statements.
This is a small program that will print out the kind of triangle an user has depending on the length of the sides the user inputs.
